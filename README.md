# Advent of Code 2022: Caleb Tries to Write Lua Edition

Every day and part is its own subdirectory (1a is the first star from day one, 1b is the second star from day one, etc.). I'm using Lua 5.4 in a Docker container. Assuming you have Docker running you can run any solution with:

`./aoc DIRECTORY`

Inputs are assumed to be at `input.txt` and solutions at `solution.lua` unless otherwise noted.
